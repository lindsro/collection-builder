## About CollectionBuilder CSV

This collection contains test images from the University of Idaho as well as test images from the University of Michigan. I will be adding to the site with a small digital collection about yarn - stories, fiber, and its impact on culture with collected items from the Library of Congress.

[CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/) is an set of open source tools for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.
See [CB Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for detailed information.
